# I dreamt today at 1:45pm, that we were in a class me and my trainees and we were given this challenge below and 3 of my trainees managed to do it and I was among people who were struggling to do it, so I woke up to clear my doubts and solve that nightmare dream. I manage to do that in less than my pomodoro timer of 25 minutes. So, i started exploring with some further data analysis challenges, fyi: these are generated by claude.ai but implementations are mine.

> Instead of crying it over, I feel proud that I am not as dumb as in my nightmare. I am human at the end of the day, I doubt if I know anything but the truth of the matter is the only to know to know that I know is prove to myself, not others, that I know.


# Initial Challenge

We have a table of 5 columns and 3 rows. each cell has numbers as values return the sum of all the values.


| 65  | 74  | 12  | 30  | 25  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20  | 44  | 10  | 40  | 55  |
| 40  | 55  | 14  | 35  | 75  |

## Initial Approach I took: 
1. how can you be able to represent such data in programming.

```js
const dataset = [
  [65,74,12,30,25],
  [20,44,10,40,55],
  [40,55,14,35,75],
];
```

2. Loop through the array and then do a reduce to the numbers within it.
```js
const sumofDataset = dataset.map((el) => {
  const datasum = el.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  return datasum;
})

```

3. Take the sum of each row and then do a reduce on the sum returned:
```js
console.log(sumofDataset.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0))
```


>[!info] Version 2: 

```js
const sum = dataset.flat().reduce((sum, curr) => sum + curr, 0)
```


# Challenge 2 - Complex Dataset Challenge: Sales Performance Analytics - Challenges generated by AI, claude.ai

## **The Scenario**

You're analyzing quarterly sales data for a tech company. Each row represents a **sales region**, each column represents a **product category**, and the values are **sales in thousands of dollars**.

|       | Laptops | Phones | Tablets | Accessories | Software |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| North | 65      | 74     | 12      | 30          | 25       |
| South | 20      | 44     | 10      | 40          | 55       |
| West  | 40      | 55     | 14      | 35          | 75       |

## **Your Challenge: Multi-Level Analysis System**

Build a system that can answer complex business questions by traversing and transforming this data.

### **Data Structure**

```js
const salesData = {
  regions: ['North', 'South', 'West'],
  products: ['Laptops', 'Phones', 'Tablets', 'Accessories', 'Software'],
  values: [
    [65, 74, 12, 30, 25],
    [20, 44, 10, 40, 55],
    [40, 55, 14, 35, 75]
  ]
};

// Additional metadata
const productCosts = {
  'Laptops': 0.6,      // 60% of revenue is cost
  'Phones': 0.5,       // 50% of revenue is cost
  'Tablets': 0.55,
  'Accessories': 0.3,
  'Software': 0.2
};

const regionTargets = {
  'North': 220,
  'South': 180,
  'West': 230
};
```

## **Questions to Solve** (In increasing complexity)

### **Level 1: Basic Aggregations**

1. What's the **total revenue** across all regions and products?
2. Which **region** has the highest total sales?
3. Which **product** generates the most revenue overall?
4. What's the average sale per region?

### **Level 2: Cross-Dimensional Analysis**

5. Which region performs best for **each product category**?
6. What percentage of total revenue does each region contribute?
7. Find the **top 3 region-product combinations** by sales value
8. Which products are **underperforming** (below average) in each region?

### **Level 3: Business Metrics**

9. Calculate **profit** (revenue - cost) for each region using `productCosts`
10. Which region has the **highest profit margin** (profit/revenue)?
11. Did each region **meet their target**? By how much did they exceed or fall short?
12. What's the **product mix** (percentage breakdown) for the best-performing region?

### **Level 4: Complex Transformations**

13. Create a **heatmap data structure**: categorize each cell as "High" (>50), "Medium" (20-50), or "Low" (<20)
14. Find **anomalies**: which region-product combinations are >2x the average for that product?
15. **Rebalance**: If you could move 20k from the best-performing region-product to the worst, which would you choose and why?

### **Level 5: Real-World Sophistication**

16. **Weighted scoring system**:
    
    - Laptops & Phones are strategic (2x weight)
    - Software has highest margin (3x weight)
    - Calculate weighted performance score per region
17. **Missing data simulation**:
    
    - South region's Tablet data is corrupted (set to null)
    - How do you calculate totals without breaking?
    - Can you estimate the missing value from patterns?
18. **Time-series projection**:
    
    - Assume this is Q1 data and each quarter grows by:
        - North: 5%
        - South: 8%
        - West: 3%
    - Project annual totals per region
19. **Constraint optimization**:
    
    - You have $50k marketing budget to boost ONE product in ONE region
    - Each $10k investment increases that cell by 15%
    - Which cell should you invest in to maximize total profit?
20. **Build a query function**:
    

```js
query(salesData, {
  filterRegions: ['North', 'West'],
  filterProducts: ['Laptops', 'Phones'],
  aggregation: 'sum',
  includeMetadata: true
})
```

## **Bonus Challenges**

**A) Handle this new data format:**

```js
// Sparse data (not all regions sell all products)
const sparseData = [
  { region: 'North', product: 'Laptops', value: 65 },
  { region: 'North', product: 'Phones', value: 74 },
  // ... (tablets missing for North)
  { region: 'South', product: 'Software', value: 55 }
];
// Convert to matrix, calculate same metrics
```

**B) Add a time dimension:**

```js
const quarterlyData = {
  'Q1': salesData,
  'Q2': { /* similar structure */ },
  'Q3': { /* similar structure */ }
};
// Find growth trends, best quarter per region, etc.
```

**C) Build a generic data engine:** Create a reusable class/functions that can work with ANY similar dataset structure (rows, columns, values) and perform configurable operations.

## **What This Teaches You**

- **Data modeling**: Representing real-world entities in code
- **Multi-dimensional traversal**: Rows × Columns × Metrics
- **Transformation pipelines**: Raw data → Insights
- **Edge case handling**: Nulls, missing data, validation
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms for large datasets
- **Abstraction**: Building reusable, configurable systems

**Start simple, build up!** Pick 3-5 questions from each level and work your way up. This is how real data analytics systems are built.
